Wave is a container format which can contain many different audio codecs.  The container format is shared with [the AVI format](../../video/avi).

By far the most common contained data is raw PCM audio.

WAVE format was widely used in the mid 1990's, although use has fallen with more modern container formats allowing more extensions, for example MP3, AAC, and MP4.
